# DepthFirstSearch
C++ Implementation of graphs and DFS


Follow instructions to perform a depth first search printing all the vertices connected to a specified vertex.

To Do: <br>
Fix visited array, maybe change to attribute of each vertex reset each time </br>
Probably change edges from vector to linked list

Future: </br>
Expand to shortest path and bipartite test. <br>
Expand to BFS and other graph algorithms\
